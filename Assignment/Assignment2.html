        <h1> Create an active Navbar</h1>
        <p>
            create an full width active navbar, use the code from the last(Friday) class for inspiration
            Links / pages on the Navbar: Home, About Me, Experience, Projects, Contact Me 
            create an active link to each page in the navbar.
            Fill in the contents of the page with whatever you want, do not leave the pages empty

            Add an active effect to each link, 
            for-example: When in the about page, the "About" page link should be highlighted out of all the other links,
            Do this for all the links/Pages in the navbar. 

            Put your profile picture in the navbar and make it fit on the same line with the links 
            The image should also be a link 
            Each link in the navbar should be clickable and it should have a hover effect
            when a mouse passes over it 

            Use css to style the links
